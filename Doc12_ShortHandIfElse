Why we should use shorthand if-else statement instead of the original one??

First of all, you have to do less typing while using the shorthand form. 
If you are making a project that requires thousands of lines of code then, it is very hectic if you are writing something in four or five lines that could easily be written in a single line. 
This advantage would not be too convincing for a lot of viewers now and they would not like to adopt the shorthand method instead of the one they are using currently. 
In this case, this tutorial is still very important for them because if you are a coder then reading other peopleâ€™s code is a must. 
Even though you are clearing your concepts by going through some code on Stack Overflow or making a group project with other programmers, you will surely encounter 
shorthand code at any time, so it is best to have a piece of prior knowledge about it.

 The second advantage of using the shorthand way of programming is that the compiler handles it in an efficient way. 
 It does not matter for the short program even though if they are a couple of thousand lines long but when working on a huge project, 
 like Amazon (12 Million lines of code) or Facebook (62 Million lines of code) or Google (2 Billion lines of code),then it is very important to save as many lines of code 
 as we can by writing it in a compact form.

There is also a disadvantage of using shorthand, that it is not easily readable. 
When we are working on a group project, we always try to choose the approach that is the easiest to understand, 
and writing a compact code always bring difficulties when we share our code with someone. 
Even though whichever approach we follow, we should always have knowledge about all possible approaches, because everyone is not using the same approach.

EXAMPLE::
    a = int(input("enter a\n"))
    b = int(input("enter b\n"))
    print("A is greater") if a > b else print("B is greater")
