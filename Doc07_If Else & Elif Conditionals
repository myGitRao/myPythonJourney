DEFINATION ::
“If, else and elif statement can be defined as a multiway decision taken by our program due to the certain conditions in our code.”
“If and else” are known as decision-making statements for our program. 
They are very similar to the decision making we apply in our everyday life that depends on certain conditions.

 An “if” statement is a must because without an if we cannot apply “else” or “else-if” statement. 

There is no limit to the number of conditions that we could use in our program. 
We can apply as many elif statements as we want but we can only use one “else” and one “if” statement.
We can use nested if statements i.e. if statement within an if statement. It is quite helpful in many cases.
Decision statements can be written using logical conditions which are:
Equal to
Not equal to
Less than
Greater than
Greater than equal to
Less than equal to
We can also use Boolean or our custom-made conditions too.

EXAMPLE::
var1 = 6
var2 = 56
var3 = int(input())
if var3>var2:
    print("Greater")
elif var3==var2:
    print("Equal")
else:
    print("Lesser")

list1 = [5, 7, 3]
print(15 not in list1)
if 15 not in list1:
    print("No its not in the list")
