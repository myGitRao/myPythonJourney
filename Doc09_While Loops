“A while loop in python runs a bunch of code or statements again and again until the given condition is true when the condition becomes false, the loop terminates its repetition.”
The syntax for while loop is simple and very much like for loop. We have to use the keyword “while”, along with it we have to put a condition in parenthesis and after that, a colon is placed. 
The condition could be either true or false. Until the condition is true, the loop will keep on executing again and again. 
If we use a certain sort of condition in our while loop that, it never becomes false then the program will keep on running endlessly, until we stop it by force.
So, this kind of mistake in our syntax is known as logical/human error.

EXAMPLE::
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
